# Prerequisites:

### Install Selenium 
1. Start a command prompt
2. Run `pip install selenium`
3. install a ***driver***:
Selenium requires a ***driver*** to interface with the chosen browser. 
Firefox, for example, requires geckodriver, which needs to be installed before the script can be run. 
Make sure it’s in your ***PATH***.

Failure to observe this step will give you an error selenium.common.exceptions.WebDriverException: Message: ‘geckodriver’ executable needs to be in PATH.

Other supported browsers will have their own drivers available. 
Links to some of the more popular browser drivers follow.
